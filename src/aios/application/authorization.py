"""Single governance authorization kernel (ADR-0011, slimmed by ADR-0016).

Every write-class and execute-class operation obtains its decision from this
kernel. The kernel judges operations, not principals: there are no roles and
no workflow transitions anymore. It reuses the compiled EffectiveGovernancePolicy
(protected paths) and the shared governed-path matcher from the domain layer;
it does not define a second set of path rules.

The kernel handles exactly five concerns: dangerous shared-Git commands,
destructive commands in the user's main worktree, the user's "input/" assets,
a small set of governance rule files, and the reasonable allowance for trusted
disposable worktrees. All checkouts use this same kernel; file cleanup
checks the actual targets, not just the caller's working directory.

The kernel never raises for policy outcomes: any failure to prove an
operation safe resolves to DENY (fail-closed), with a stable rule id and
reason for audit trails.
